# Tactus 🤌
A swift toolbox for complex haptic feedback design. Wraps CoreHaptics with a number of useful features and some optional, but simplified interfaces.


🏗️ _work in progress_ 🚧

For now, you can open the project in Xcode- and preview some of the graphing stuff by opening up `ChartView.swift` and enabling previews. I'm having a lot of fun playing with the lovely [Swift Splines](https://github.com/Bersaelor/SwiftSplines) right now.
